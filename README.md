# Text-Extraction
# WHAT COVERD IN THIS PROJECTS
1. In this project, we will be working on extracting text from images. After extracting the text we will apply some basic functions of OpenCV on that text to enhance it and to get more accurate results. This project will be very useful as it will save time and effort of typing from an image.
# THE STEPS TAKEN TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM
1. DOWNLOADING TESSERACT AND INSTALL IT WITH OTHER DEPENDENCIES
2. LOADING THE IMAGE FOR TEXT EXTRACTION, RESIZING IT, AND THEN SAVE IT.
3. USING PYTESSERACT TO EXTRACT TEXT FROM THE IMAGE.
4. PROCESSING THE TEXT EXTRACTED FROM THE IMAGE.
5. USING COMPUTER VISION FOR FUTHER PROCESSING OF COMPLEX IMAGES.
6. REMOVING NOISE FROM THE IMAGE USING THE BLUR FUNCTION.
7. PERFORM THRESHOLD TRANSFORMATION OF THE IMAGE.
8. USING ERODE FUNCTION OF CV2 ON IMAGE.
9. PERFORMENCE SOME OTHER IAMGE PROCESSING OPERATIONS.
10. DRAWING RECTANGLES CHARACTER AND A PARTICULAR PATTERN/WORD.

# GOAL OF PROJECT
1. Different organizations can use this to extract use full information from the image and store it. Individual can use it for saving their time and effort for typing.
2. It will ease the burden of document analysis and understanding them. It will reduce man work and revolutionlize the system by automating the OCR(OPTICAL CHARACTER RECOGNIZATION) mathod fot text extraction.
